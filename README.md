# Alex's Compiler

This is a simple compiler based on SSA just for learning purposes.
And I hope it can generate multiple assembly for different target machines.
Its IR is like llvm ir.

TODO:
* Some Scalar Optimizations
* Tree Pattern Matching (BURS or something like dfa)
* SSA Pre
* Construct SSA Linearlly
* Transition out of SSA
* Loop Optimization
* Vectorization
* Memory SSA

TARGETS:
* RISCV
* X86
* ARM
